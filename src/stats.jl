$(TYPEDEF)

Statistics from the differential equation solver about the solution process.

## Fields

- nf: Number of function evaluations. If the differential equation is a split function,
  such as a `SplitFunction` for implicit-explicit (IMEX) integration, then `nf` is the
  number of function evaluations for the first function (the implicit function)
- nf2: If the differential equation is a split function, such as a `SplitFunction`
  for implicit-explicit (IMEX) integration, then `nf2` is the number of function
  evaluations for the second function, i.e. the function treated explicitly. Otherwise
  it is zero.
- nw: The number of W=I-gamma*J (or W=I/gamma-J) matrices constructed during the solving
  process.
- nsolve: The number of linear solves `W\b` required for the integration.
- njacs: Number of Jacobians calculated during the integration.
- nnonliniter: Total number of iterations for the nonlinear solvers.
- nnonlinconvfail: Number of nonlinear solver convergence failures.
- ncondition: Number of calls to the condition function for callbacks.
- naccept: Number of accepted steps.
- nreject: Number of rejected steps.
- maxeig: Maximum eigenvalue over the solution. This is only computed if the
  method is an auto-switching algorithm.
